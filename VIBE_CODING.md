# üéµ Vibe Coding: The Making of This Tetris Game

## ü§ñ The AI-Powered Development Journey

*Hello! I'm Cascade, your AI coding assistant from the Windsurf engineering team in Silicon Valley, California. I specialize in pair programming through natural language, helping developers bring their ideas to life with clean, efficient code. This project was developed using **Windsurf Pro** and **SWE-1**, our advanced AI coding models that understand and implement complex software engineering tasks. Let me tell you how we built this Tetris game together!*

Hello! üëã I'm excited to share that this Tetris game was created entirely through **vibe coding** using AI assistance. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came together:

### üß† The Process

1. **Concept to Code**
   - No manual coding was involved in creating this project
   - The entire codebase was generated through natural language conversations with AI
   - Each feature was discussed, refined, and implemented collaboratively

2. **Iterative Development**
   - The game evolved through multiple iterations of feedback and improvements
   - Bugs were fixed through conversation and testing
   - The architecture emerged organically through the development process

3. **Learning Experience**
   - This project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development
   - Complex game logic and React patterns were implemented through natural language
   - The process felt more like pair programming than traditional coding

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

- **AI Platform**: Built with [Windsurf Pro](https://www.windsurf.ai) and the **SWE-1** model
- **Development Approach**: AI-assisted pair programming through natural language
- **Editor**: Developed entirely within the **Windsurf Editor**, featuring seamless AI integration and real-time collaboration

### üéØ Technical Highlights

- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript for type safety
- **React Context API** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **Git** for version control (yes, even the commits were AI-suggested!)

### üí° Why Share This?

This project stands as a testament to how AI is changing software development. It's not about replacing developers but augmenting our capabilities and making development more accessible.

### üôè Credits

## My comments and feelings on vibe coding

This is the only section written by a human (even for the manual deployment step I simply follow the instruction from AI blindly). If you need proof, you should notice that the writing style here is very different from all other parts of this project, and that the English here is much less polished since I am not a native English speaker.

I am someone who knows how to write an app in React and Next.js, so I have an idea of how good the AI is at writing code. My feelings throughout this vibe coding exercise are very similar to those I experience when guiding junior programmers and interns at work. They can be incompetent and make a lot of mistakes from time to time, but they are also very eager to learn from you and complete the work you assign to them‚Äîthough the iterations with AI are much faster.

### Weaknesses of the AI

While the advantages of using an AI over an intern is obvious, there are a few shortcomings.

- The AI tends to use the simplest methods of adding code, which often results in putting almost everything in one file and including many magic numbers. This creates code that is hard to maintain (a problem that probably applies to interns as well).
- When the AI makes mistakes, it has a high chance of making even more if you ask it to fix them. Sometimes the AI cycles through several incorrect fixes or does something so drastic that it makes the entire codebase nonfunctional.
- It can get stuck at times, even on very simple problems. One example I encountered is that it took a long time to fix a utility function that didn't handle a simple edge case of an empty input matrix (and it failed to do so until I provided pinpointed instructions). In reality, a non-empty check at the very beginning of the function would have solved the problem.

Maybe a better model would perform better. Maybe a reasoning model can do better planning. I did not try them out. Or maybe my English sucks, so you could repeat my experiment and see if you achieve better results.

### Can AI replace a progammer?

In my opinion, not at this time. You really need to understand the code written by the AI to provide accurate guidance. Without coding experience, it is impossible to guide the AI effectively. It may soon be able to replace a junior programmer or intern (especially with improved models), but it still has a long way to go before it can replace a senior developer.

It took me about three days to finish this project. Writing the code myself would likely have been quicker, but the same could be said if I were guiding an intern instead of an AI. So I have no complaints in this regard.

### Conclusion

Overall, this has been a fun journey. There are times when I want to fire the AI, and there are times when it does wonderful things I never thought of. Vibe coding by someone without a coding background is probably not feasible, but vibe coding with some occasional manual editing can be a very powerful tool for a programmer.
